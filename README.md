# AND101 Project 3 - Duolingo

Submitted by: **Dosbol Aliev**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Duolingo** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **This Android app, AnimalApp, replicates a daily goal screen inspired by Duolingo, featuring an animal mascot and progress messages. It uses ConstraintLayout for flexible design, custom fonts for improved style, and a rounded button created with shape drawables. Tooltips enhance usability by providing helpful hints, making the app both visually appealing and user-friendly**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ¦‰ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“±
